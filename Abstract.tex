\section*{Abstract}
Deep learning based classifier has achieved tremendous success on different tasks. However, this kind of classifier can't provide reliable uncertainty estimation about their predictions and express excessive overconfidence, which means that models are highly certain about what they are not familiar with. This behavior can easily lead to severe consequences in safety-critical applications such as diagnosis of diseases, perception of self-driving car and so on. Especially in case of deployment of robots, the robots should be aware of the correctness of prediction they made, so that they can be able to avoid unnecessary accidents and adapt itself in an unfamiliar environment. Besides uncertainty for independent data example, uncertainty related to dependencies between data examples should be taken into account. When recognizing objects with similar appearances but different contexts in specific scene, discriminative classifier should express reliably high uncertainty about its prediction because of appearance ambiguity. At the same time, contextual information should be handled properly and utilized to resolve this kind of ambiguity, aiming to improve performance further. 

In this work, Bayesian neural networks with different inference techniques such as dropout variational inference and scalable Laplace approximation are employed to improve uncertainty estimation. With reliable uncertainty estimation, classifier trained on easily obtainable dataset previously should be able to adapt itself in test environment by collecting dataset for fine-tuning with as little manual efforts as possible. Additionally, conditional random field is employed to improve the performance further by utilizing more information brought by better uncertainty estimation and handling the contextual information between objects properly. Extensive experiments are performed to show that uncertainty estimation can be improved with Bayesian neural network in terms of different evaluation metrics. Besides, we demonstrate that manual efforts in collecting dataset for fine-tuning classifier can be reduced with help of improved uncertainty estimation on experiments with two different datasets. Last but not least, experiments also show that conditional random field is able to improve the performance further by making use of better uncertainty estimation and contextual information.
